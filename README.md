## What does the script do:

### Content Script (`content-script.js`):

- This script seamlessly integrates into web pages, facilitating interactions with their content.
- It incorporates a `debounce` function, strategically delaying the execution of actions to prevent overwhelming the LanguageTool API with excessive requests.
- The `displayCorrection` function visually annotates errors within text by intelligently inserting "(faute ici)" (error here) at the precise locations.
- Utilizing the `checkAndDisplayCorrections` function, text content undergoes meticulous scrutiny via the LanguageTool API, with detected errors promptly marked for review.
- Employing a MutationObserver, the script dynamically monitors DOM changes, particularly the addition of new sentence elements, to initiate error-checking procedures.

### Manifest (`manifest.json`):

- Metadata and permissions are meticulously defined to ensure seamless functionality of the extension.
- Permissions are granted for accessing active tabs and communicating with the LanguageTool API.
- A background script (`background.js`) is designated to handle browser action events.
- Content scripts are configured to operate across all URLs, encompassing `content-script.js`.
- Diverse icon sizes are provided to enhance visual representation.

### Background Script (`background.js`):

- This script attentively listens for user interactions, specifically clicks on the extension's icon.
- Upon detection of user action, it orchestrates the execution of the content script (`content-script.js`) within the active tab, facilitating error detection and correction.
